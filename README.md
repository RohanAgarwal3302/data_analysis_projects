# DATA JOB ESSENTIALS

### Introduction

In the start of our journey in the field of Data science or Data analysis, we all have wondered how we can transition into this field, what do we need, and what we can expect from this. Well this is the place where all those questions will be answered. In this proect I have analysed Job posting for data related jobs from "Glassdoor" and found out some of the key factors that are often seen in such job postings, like min qualification, expected salary, which programing languages are required the most, where and under whom we can expext to work.

### About the dataset

The dataset contains details of 600+ job postings from Glassdoor. Dataset was downloaded form Kaggle under the name "Data Science Job Posting on Glassdoor". There are two versions of the dataset available for kaggle: "cleaned" and "uncleaned". I have used the uncleaned dataset to tailor it according to our needs. The timeframe during which data was collected is not mentioned and the dataset was last updated in 2021. 

### Process

I have divided my project into two parts: 

First is "Data_Cleaning" in which I have cleaned the data using python. I have used pandas and regular expressions libraries for this. Unwanted data is removed, old columns are formatted and new columns are created.

Second part is "Data_Viz" in which a dashboard is created to visualize key findings from the dataset and give user an interactive enviroment to better look in the dataset and give them control to find out what they are looking for.
